For loans between $25,000 and $200,000: The lender can seize business assets as collateral, and the impact on personal credit depends on whether the loan was taken using an EIN or Social Security number.For loans over $200,000: Business assets will be seized, and personal assets may also be at risk due to the personal guarantee required for these loans.",
